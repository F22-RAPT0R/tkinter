im using anki application to memorize english vocabulary
i have divided my vocabs in to multiple sessions
each session has its own review schedule
in each session, difficulty of each voacb is denoted with flag in anki ranging from 0 to 9
bigger flag number means higher difficulty

i usually review multiple lessons simultaneously via filtered deck in anki which i should specify which lessons i want to review(deck in anki term) and what difficulty
this is done via a filter string
this program does this
you specify lessons and diffuclty that you want to review, program gives you filter string
it also copies the string to clipboard
so just paste it in anki filter input
